# URL Shortener API 🌐

## Overview 📖

The URL Shortener API is a Java-based Spring Boot application that provides a service for shortening long URLs. Users can create short URLs with expiration dates, update existing short URLs, and redirect to the original long URLs. This project uses a SQL database for persistence and is integrated with a React front end, demonstrating practical use of Spring Boot and SQL in building a URL shortening service.
